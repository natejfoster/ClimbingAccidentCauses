    <h1>Accidents in North American Climbing</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This is a visual look at the causes of accidents in North American climbing, and how each
      cause contributes to the total number of accidents. Causes in blue are "Immediate" causes,
      and causes in orange are "Contributing" causes. Please note that while both data for the
      time period of 1959 to 2014 and 2015 alone can be viewed, comparisons between the two
      should not be made as the totals are significantly smaller for 2015. This is also the case
      for USA vs Canada. The purpose is to see how the causes of accidents compare to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data used is from the 2016 edition of <em>Accidents in North American Climbing</em>
      published by the American Alpine Club.

        On your webpage, you must provide a detailed defense of your choice of visual encodings and control
        features. For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data
        effectively (~ 1 paragraph).

      <p>
        Then, for each controlling element, detail how it enables your user to
        ask different questions (~1 paragraph). You should include specific examples of insights you discovered
        through the use of these tools.

        The conrolling elements of this visualization are pretty simple. It allows the viewer to
        specify if they wish to view the data for the United States or for Canada. For each of
        these options, the viewer can specify the time period they would like to see: a range of 1959 to 2014, or
        just the data for 2015. The country control allowed
