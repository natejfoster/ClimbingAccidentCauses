    <h1>Accidents in North American Climbing</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This is a visual look at the causes of accidents in North American climbing, and how each
      cause contributes to the total number of accidents. Causes in blue are "Immediate" causes,
      and causes in orange are "Contributing" causes. Please note that while both data for the
      time period of 1959 to 2014 and 2015 alone can be viewed, comparisons between the two
      should not be made as the totals are significantly smaller for 2015. This is also the case
      for USA vs Canada. The purpose is to see how the causes of accidents compare to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data used is from the 2016 edition of <em>Accidents in North American Climbing</em>
      published by the American Alpine Club.

      <h3>Explanation</h3>

        On your webpage, you must provide a detailed defense of your choice of visual encodings and control
        features. For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data
        effectively (~ 1 paragraph).
        <br />
        For my dataset, I decided on a treemap. A treemap lended itself well to the hierarchical structure I
        wanted to create for this visualization. Ideally, I would have multiple levels of the nesting as opposed
        to controls, but my skillset is not yet that developed to implement it. While treemaps depend on the ability
        to distinquish differences in areas, they are visually pleasing and still provide a reasonable ability to
        compare the data. Therefore, to assist with comparisons using treemap structure, I added the total number of
        accidents for each accident cause.
      </p>

        The conrolling elements of this visualization are pretty simple. It allows the viewer to
        specify if they wish to view the data for the United States or for Canada. For each of
        these options, the viewer can also specify the time period they would like to see: a range of 1959 to 2014, or
        just the data for 2015. The country control allowed me to quickly identify what cause was the most significant
        for both countries: fall or slip on rock. By being able to control the time period that is displayed,
        I am able to remove the potential factors of older gear being less secure, robust, or in some cases,
        not existing for the earlier portions of the time period. This gives me a better idea of how these causes
        compare with current equimpent and practices. Originally, I was planning on having a control to specify
        whether the causes displayed were immediate or contributing. Ultimately, I decided to include both in all
        visualiztions, and color code them according to type. This allows both to be compared in the same context.
